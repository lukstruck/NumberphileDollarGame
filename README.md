# NumberphileDollarGame
A simple implementation of the "Dollar Game" shown on the YouTube channel "Numberphile" with HTML and JS.

A Demo is available at <lukace.space/main/>

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/lukstruck/NumberphileDollarGame.git
```

Open the index.html in your browser of choice and you are ready to go! (No guarantee that it will work outside of Chrome, Firefox and Safari)

## Usage

Clicking on a node (vertice) will perform the current selected action, so either send 1 to all connected neighbours or receive 1 from all connected neighbours. You can change that action by clicking on the button with the text in the top right.

```New Graph``` will generate a new graph / network, or if you're in the tutorial, it will reset the current stage.

```Reset Graph``` will reset the current graph / network to it's initial state, in case you messed up and really want to go back...

```Take money from connected nodes``` or ```Give money to connected nodes``` toggles between the two available mods. Just click the button to toggle between them.

### Advanced options

Clicking on the menu icon in the top right will open the settings. No further doc yet as they will probably change often.
